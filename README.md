# .dotfiles

My personal dotfiles. So it always feels like `$HOME`...

## Installation

Almost everything is automated thanks to a bunch of scripts and [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).
Just clone this repository and run the install script:

```
git clone https://github.com/martindzejky/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install
```

### Manual steps

Make sure to install and use a [Powerline-patched font](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) or
any font with powerline symbols for the [agnoster theme](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/theme-agnoster) to work.
